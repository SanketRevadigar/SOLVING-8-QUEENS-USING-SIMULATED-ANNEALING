# SOLVING-8-QUENNS-USING-SIMULATED-ANNEALING
Simulated annealing is a probabilistic global search optimization algorithm. This means that  randomness is used as part of the search process. This makes this algorithm suitable for nonlinear objective functions where other local search algorithms do not work well
